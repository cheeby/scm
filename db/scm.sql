Having graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Rome in 1896 as a physician, Dr. Montessori was familiar with young children and became interested in their growth and learning.</p>\r\n\t<p align="justify">\r\n\t\tThrough careful and exhaustive scrutiny, noticing that the children spontaneously chose and worked with the learning materials she provided,&nbsp;she realized that children construct their own personalities and that they have a preference for the manner in which they learn. She also realized that certain characteristics of the mind change as the child develops.&nbsp;Montessori discovered that by offering a learning environment created uniquely for and adapted to the psychological characteristics of the child at each stage of development, learning not only comes more easily but is more spontaneous and exciting.</p>\r\n\t<p align="justify">\r\n\t\tHer approach to education stemmed from a solid grounding in biology, psychiatry and anthropology. She studied children of all races and cultures in many countries, soon seeing the universal human development playing out before her.</p>\r\n\t<p align="justify">\r\n\t\tMaria Montessori opened her first Casa dei Bambini (Children&#39;s House) in one of the very poorest areas in Rome - Quartiere di San Lorenzo.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="ctl13_placeholder" viewstate="false">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<em>&quot;It was January 6th (1907), when the first school was opened for small, normal children of between three and six years of age. I cannot say on my methods, for these did not yet exist. But in the school that was opened my method was shortly to come into being. On that day there was nothing to be seen but about fifty wretchedly poor children, rough and shy in manner, many of them crying, almost all the children of illiterate parents, who had been entrusted to my care&quot;... &quot;They were tearful, frightened children, so shy that it was impossible to get them to speak; their faces were expressionless, with bewildered eyes as though they had never seen anything in their lives.&quot;... &quot;It would be interesting to know the original circumstances that enabled these children to undergo such an extraordinary transformation,&nbsp;or rather, that brought about the appearance of new children, whose souls revealed themselves with such radiance as to spread a light through the whole world.&quot;</em></p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t- Dr. Maria Montessori</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id="ctl14_placeholder" viewstate="false">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIndeed it was as though this radiance had been caught in a stream of consciousness, for a mere six months after the opening of the Casa dei Bambini, people from all walks of life and from every continent came to see Maria Montessori&#39;s miracle children.</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIn 1909 she gave her first Montessori course, expecting to have only Italian teachers as students. To her amazement people attended from many different countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tMaria Montessori was a scientist, and as a good scientist, she was earth-bound and highly spiritual in her pursuit of truth. She studied medicine, specializing in psychiatry and anthropology. She was also an outstanding mathematician. Although she would never have considered being a teacher, she studied educational methods for many years and&nbsp;continued her observations throughout her life, widening and deepening her understanding until her death in 1952.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n	t	maria.jpg	t	2013-01-03 19:11:54.286871	2013-01-03 19:12:51.352578			maria-montessori
11	toddler	6	<p>\r\n\t&quot;I need to discover what I can do.&quot;</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe Toddler Community supports the abilities of the very young child. Our program is a partnership with parents, who are the first and most essential teachers of the child. Our teachers, or more accurately &quot;guides,&quot; are trained in child development. The importance of the period between sixteen and thirty-six months cannot be underestimated as research is helping us become more aware of the critical time this plays in the development of a child&#39;s cognitive abilities, social skills, sense of trust and personality. Montessori education is based on a deep respect for the latent abilities of the child.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe child develops by means of experience in his or her environment. We call such experience &quot;work.&quot; It is this work which assists the child in construction of one&#39;s self. Independence, language, sensory integration, motor development, and order are the primary learning areas in which the toddler age child works to construct him or herself.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur program supports the child&#39;s journey towards independence in a safe environment where the rhythm is toddler-paced and everything is toddler-sized, including low furniture, shelves, easily movable chairs, and artwork hung at eye-level. The sinks and refrigerator are real and accessible to the children. Through observation of other children, each toddler becomes curious about how to independently use the toilet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe toddler age is the key stage in language acquisition. Our language-rich environment includes language materials and activities, music and song, reading and conversation, and exposure to Spanish.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tExploration and discovery are a primary need at this age. Our Toddler House provides an aesthetic and sensory-rich environment in which the young child is free to safely explore with the respectful assistance and encouragement of the adult.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMovement is the need of the young child. The developing brain is stimulated and enhanced through movement, both small and large muscle, which must be perfected through practice. Our gross motor area within the classroom allows each child to move seamlessly between large and small muscle activities as needed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWe support a child&#39;s need for consistency and order by having a place for everything and putting everything back in its place during clean-up time. Our daily rhythm alternates between active and restful group and individual activities. Our seasonal rhythm includes gardening in spring, harvest and raking in autumn, and cooking and snow play during the winter. Walks on our lovely 15-acre campus are taken all year long.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOur all-day program provides consistency in staff and continuity in environment. The self-assurance and independence gained through the work in the toddler environment not only prepares the child to move successfully to the next level (the Primary Classroom), but also lays the foundation for confident and joyful learning for life.</p>\r\n	t	toddlers2008.jpg	t	2013-01-03 19:17:15.613842	2013-01-03 20:02:32.181731			toddler
12	application procedure	8	<p>\r\n\tSteps to enrollment at St. Croix Montessori School</p>\r\n	<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>I. Inquiry/Visit</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tPlease&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@stcroixmontessori.org"><strong>contact</strong></a>&nbsp;the school to schedule a visit. Parents are strongly encouraged to visit the school without&nbsp;children&nbsp;before applying. Carefully review St. Croix Montessori School&#39;s program offerings, mission statement and core values and beliefs. During the visit, parents will observe our classrooms and learn more about our school and the Montessori philosophy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>II. The Application</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tComplete the application form and send with the $100.00 non-refundable fee to SCMS. Call the school or download an application.<a href="http://stcroixmontessori.org/files/stcroixmontessori/files/Application%2012-13%20single%20pages.pdf" tabindex="0"><strong>Application for Admission to St. Croix Montessori School&nbsp;</strong></a><a href="http://stcroixmontessori.org/files/stcroixmontessori/files/SCM%20Application%20form%2011-12.pdf" tabindex="0"><img border="0" height="14" src="http://www.stcroixmontessori.org/images/programs/pdf_Icon.gif" width="14" /></a><em>&nbsp;<strong><em><a tabindex="0"><strong>print, complete &amp; fax or mail</strong></a></em></strong></em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>III. Acceptance</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAcceptance of a child is based on several factors. The most important is the match of the family&#39;s and the school&#39;s educational goals for the child. Siblings of present contracted students are given priority, while new applicants are selected for the remaining spaces. One of our goals is to maintain gender and age balance within the classrooms.&nbsp; The first round of acceptances takes place the middle of February. Decisions are sent by mail. Accompanying the acceptance letter is an Enrollment Contract which must be completed and returned to the school with the $500.00 non-refundable tuition deposit &nbsp;within fourteen days. Depending on availability of space, additional rounds of acceptances will take place the middle of each month.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>V. Waiting Pool&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tIf there are no available spaces, applicants will be placed in our waiting pool. You will be notified when a place becomes available.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVI. Placement&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tFamilies will be notified of class placement by mail. The balance of age and gender are kept in mind as much as possible when assigning children to classrooms. The Montessori Method gives children the advantage of a mixed age classroom, so younger students are stretched by seeing the work of the older students, while older students grow from a meaningful leadership role in the class.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe mission of St. Croix Montessori School is to provide an ideal learning environment based on Montessori principles that will guide and nurture the full development of the individual.</p>\r\n	t	\N	f	2013-01-03 19:20:15.004802	2013-01-03 19:20:15.004802			application-procedure
